# SortAlgo
Performance analysis of various sorting algorithms

Coding and outline is based on my StackSkills Course, "Python Programming, CS, Algorithms and Data Structures" by Mashrur Hossain

The code compares six different number sorting algorithms:
1. Bubble Sort
2. Selection Sort
3. Insertion Sort
4. Quick Sort
5. Merge Sort
6. Python's Built-In Sorted() function
