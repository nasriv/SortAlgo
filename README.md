# SortAlgo
Performance analysis of various sorting algorithms

Code and outline is based on my experience completing the StackSkills Course, "Python Programming, CS, Algorithms and Data Structures" by Mashrur Hossain (https://stackskills.com/p/python-programming-cs-algorithms-and-data-structures#)


The code compares the time to sort six different number sorting algorithms for various lengths of arrays:
1. Bubble Sort
2. Selection Sort
3. Insertion Sort
4. Quick Sort
5. Merge Sort
6. Python's Built-In Sorted() function
